## Why a Student Recommendation System

In many educational settings, students are presented with large amounts of information — courses, resources, learning paths, performance metrics — but very little guidance on **what to focus on next**.

The goal of this project was not to predict outcomes for the sake of prediction, but to build a **decision-support system** that could help students make more informed academic choices.

This distinction shaped every technical decision that followed.

---

## Problem Definition

The core problem was framed as:

> How can we use historical and behavioural data to provide **useful, interpretable recommendations** that support student learning without replacing human judgement?

This immediately ruled out approaches that were:

- opaque
- overly complex
- difficult to explain to non-technical users

The system needed to assist, not dictate.

---

## Data and Feature Engineering

Rather than relying on raw data alone, emphasis was placed on **feature engineering**.

The types of features considered included:

- academic performance indicators
- engagement and participation patterns
- historical progression trends
- time-based signals (e.g. consistency over time)

Equally important were the features deliberately **excluded**:

- sensitive personal attributes
- signals that could introduce bias
- variables that lacked clear interpretability

This step reinforced a key lesson: **better features often matter more than more data**.

---

## Model Selection and Rationale

Instead of jumping directly to complex models, I prioritised approaches that balanced:

- performance
- interpretability
- ease of evaluation

Baseline models were explored first to establish a reference point.  
More complex models were only considered when they demonstrated clear, measurable improvement.

This incremental approach made it easier to:

- understand model behaviour
- diagnose errors
- explain outputs to stakeholders

The goal was not to maximise accuracy at all costs, but to produce **reliable and explainable recommendations**.

---

## Evaluation Strategy

Evaluating a recommendation system requires more nuance than a single metric.

Beyond standard performance measures, attention was paid to:

- consistency of recommendations
- stability across different student profiles
- sensitivity to noisy or incomplete inputs

In an educational context, a “good” model is not one that always predicts aggressively, but one that behaves **reasonably under uncertainty**.

---

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

Any system making recommendations in education carries ethical implications.

Key considerations included:

- avoiding reinforcement of existing inequalities
- preventing over-reliance on automated recommendations
- ensuring transparency in how recommendations are generated

This project was designed with the assumption that:

> AI should support human decision-making, not replace it.

Clear limitations were acknowledged, particularly around data quality and contextual factors that models cannot fully capture.

---

## What I Learned Building This System

This project reinforced several important lessons about applied machine learning:

- Problem framing matters as much as model choice
- Simpler models are often more useful in real-world settings
- Interpretability is not optional in high-impact domains
- Evaluation should reflect how systems are actually used

Most importantly, it highlighted how **machine learning systems live within broader human contexts**, not isolated pipelines.

---

## What I Would Improve Next

Given more time and data, future iterations could explore:

- richer contextual features
- user feedback loops to refine recommendations
- tighter integration between model outputs and user interfaces
- longitudinal evaluation of recommendation impact

These improvements would move the system closer to real-world deployment scenarios.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Building a student recommendation system was less about maximising model performance and more about learning how to apply machine learning responsibly.

It pushed me to think critically about **why** a model exists, **who** it serves, and **how** its outputs should be interpreted.

That mindset continues to shape how I approach machine learning projects today — focusing on impact, clarity, and thoughtful application rather than complexity for its own sake.
