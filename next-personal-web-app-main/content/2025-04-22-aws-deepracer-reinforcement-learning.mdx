## The AWS DeepRacer Competition

AWS DeepRacer is more than a technical exercise.  
It’s a competitive environment where reinforcement learning models are tested not just for correctness, but for **behaviour, efficiency, and consistency**.

At Humber College, the DeepRacer competition brought together students experimenting with reinforcement learning in a very practical way. Models were trained, evaluated, retrained, and ultimately judged by how well they performed on the track — not by how elegant the theory looked on paper.

That shift from abstract learning to observable results made the experience stand out.

## Competition Dynamics

The competitive aspect fundamentally changed how I approached the problem.

Instead of asking:

> “Does this reward function make sense?”

The question became:

> “Does this reward function actually win?”

Small differences in:

- reward shaping
- speed incentives
- steering penalties

led to noticeable differences in lap time and stability.

This made it clear that **reinforcement learning is as much about iteration and experimentation as it is about theory**.

## Cambrian College Placing First

One of the highlights of the competition was seeing **Cambrian College place first overall**.

That result wasn’t about a single perfect model — it reflected:

- consistent experimentation
- learning from failed runs
- sharing insights across teams
- refining approaches rather than starting over repeatedly

Being part of an environment that performed at that level reinforced the idea that **applied machine learning thrives in collaborative, iterative settings**.

## What I Personally Learned

The biggest lessons weren’t about tools — they were about mindset.

### Reward Functions Encode Behaviour

I learned very quickly that a reward function doesn’t just guide learning, it defines values.  
Reward the wrong thing, and the model will exploit it perfectly.

### Metrics Aren’t the Whole Story

High reward values didn’t always translate to good driving behaviour.  
Watching the car perform revealed issues that metrics alone couldn’t capture.

### Iteration Beats Perfection

Models improved fastest when changes were small, measurable, and intentional.  
Large rewrites often set progress back.

## How This Pushed Me Toward AI & Machine Learning

Before DeepRacer, machine learning felt distant — something that lived in notebooks and datasets.

DeepRacer changed that.

It showed me:

- how models **interact with environments**
- how learning emerges from feedback
- how design decisions directly influence outcomes

Seeing a model learn through trial, failure, and adaptation made AI feel tangible and practical. That experience pushed me to explore machine learning more deeply, not as a theoretical discipline, but as a system for decision-making and behaviour.

It was a turning point in how I approached my studies and projects moving forward.

## Looking Back

The AWS DeepRacer competition wasn’t just about racing a model car.  
It was about understanding how learning systems behave under pressure, constraints, and competition.

Seeing my school place first, while being immersed in that process, reinforced my interest in AI and machine learning — and clarified the kind of problems I want to work on going forward: **systems where learning, feedback, and real-world behaviour intersect**.
