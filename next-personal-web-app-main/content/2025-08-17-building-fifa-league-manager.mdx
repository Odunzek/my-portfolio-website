## Why I Built This

Managing FIFA (EA FC) leagues manually gets chaotic very quickly.  
Spreadsheets break, group chats get messy, and tracking fixtures, results, and standings becomes unreliable.

I built the **FIFA League Manager** to solve that problem with a proper system — one that updates in real time, enforces structure, and removes ambiguity from league management.

This wasn’t a “toy project”. It was built to behave like a real application people could actually use.

---

## Core Goals

From the start, the project had a few clear goals:

- Real-time updates for matches and league tables
- Simple but structured data modelling
- Controlled access to match result entry
- A clean UI that doesn’t get in the way

Everything else was secondary.

---

## Tech Stack

The stack was chosen intentionally, not randomly:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for structure and routing
- **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data syncing
- **Firebase Authentication** for access control
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast, consistent styling

Firestore was the obvious choice here — the real-time listeners are a perfect fit for live league tables and match updates.

---

## High-Level Architecture

At a high level, the system works like this:

- Users interact with the Next.js frontend
- Match results are written to Firestore
- Firestore listeners propagate updates instantly
- League tables recalculate and update in real time

There’s no manual refresh logic.  
If a match result changes, the table updates automatically.

That real-time feedback loop was a core design requirement.

## Data Modelling Decisions

One of the most important parts of this project was **data modelling**.

Instead of trying to store everything in one place, I separated concerns clearly:

- **Leagues**: metadata and configuration
- **Members**: participants tied to a league
- **Matches**: results, fixtures, and timestamps

This separation made it much easier to:

- update league standings
- add new features later (tournaments, group stages)
- avoid tightly coupled data

Firestore rewards clean structure. This project made that very clear.

## Key Challenges

### Real-Time Consistency

Real-time updates sound great until multiple users interact with the same data.

I had to be careful about:

- when recalculations happen
- avoiding conflicting updates
- keeping derived values consistent

The solution was to centralize certain calculations and avoid duplicating logic across components.

---

### Controlled Match Entry

Not everyone should be able to enter or edit match results.

I implemented basic access control so:

- only authorized users can submit scores
- league integrity is maintained
- accidental edits are reduced

This part sounds small, but it matters a lot in real usage.

---

## What I Learned

This project reinforced a few important lessons:

- Real-time systems magnify bad data design
- Clean structure beats clever hacks every time
- Firebase is powerful, but only if you respect its constraints
- Building for real users changes how you think about edge cases

Most importantly, it reminded me that **production thinking** starts early — not after the project “works”.

---

## What’s Next

The current system works well, but there’s room to grow:

- Tournament formats (group stages, knockouts)
- Historical match analytics
- Better role-based permissions
- Improved admin tooling

Those are planned extensions, not afterthoughts.

---

## Closing Thoughts

The FIFA League Manager was built to solve a real problem, not just to tick a box.

It combines real-time data, structured modelling, and practical UI decisions — and it reflects how I approach building software: start simple, design intentionally, and scale responsibly.
